# Game

Family-feud style game for Twitch. The Twitch streamer (host and participants) survey the viewers for any question. Our backend compiles and groups the responses into the top categories for the host and particpants to play!

Running the admin/host client app for managing the game and displaying the host panel:
`cd client`
`npm start`

Running the twitch extension app for submitting survey answers:
`cd twitch-extension/extensions-boilerplate`
`npm start`

Running the backend
`cd server`
`npm run webpack`
`npm start`
